DATA CONNECTION - RELATIONSHIPS

Context
We want to have an abstraction for the data supplied to the report.

This should be sufficiently flexible to cope with a wide range of typical reports including nesting bands with grouping clauses and filling in styled-text.

In particular, therefore, we need to abstract how relationships between data sources are traversed and appropriate data iteration takes place in dependent sources.

ALTERNATIVES
1) This is not our problem - the dependent source is mapped by a user class which includes the relationship traversal from a primary object which HAS been iterated. 

2) We provide dependency trackers that broadcast iteration, which user declares as one source depending on another.

DATA CONNECTION - LOADING REPEATED DATA

The OOFILE approach is for the oofRep class to know that it has an oofRepViewBand as a top level band. It explicitly iterates the view, calling the draw method on the band each time.

Whilst this seems at first blush to be an awkward factoring, it means the report layout and rendering classes have no knowledge of any iteration logic which is a good thing.

This model has proved fairly robust with the slightly hacky approach of using a  view band with no associated dbView to render a single pass of the attached headers and footers.

ALTERNATIVES
1) Echo the OOFILE model where a single iterator is associated with the body and the rbrwReport class iterates that single top-level iterator.
- may be awkward to explain why an iterable source
- fairly robust model

2) Extend the OOFILE model - have a body band list and body iterators called by the rbrwReport.
- extends robust model
- allows us to have top-level bands without iterators

3) Event-driven iteration.
Rather than specifically triggering iterators, have generalised event broadcasting and have data iterators as listeners.
- lot of generalisation could be awkward, slow
- hard to see immediate benefit

DECISION - 2

DATA SOURCES VS RENDEREDR

Context
We want a pattern for putting things on the graphics context - mostly text but occasionally pictures or user-defined rendering.

This relates to how we "advance" page position.

To decide - with columnar layout is that 

1) a different band type, 
- using a different positioner?

2) a standard band called repeatedly due to iterators 
- how do we know which band to iterate?

3) a composite wrapping a normal band?


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
ADVANCING VERTICAL COORDS
Context:
Need to advance a vertical position.

- for simple bands
- for groups of simple bands
- within something that repeatedly draws content (eg: columnar bands)

Side-thoughts
Is the model for ColumnarBand incorrect - should it be a generalisation of a composite model, as a thing that contains more than one thing to draw?

That would make it a lot easier to cope with the idea of forcing things to be kept together and allows for nested break levels.

Forces:
1) We want a consistent way in the architecture for similar classes.

ALTERNATIVES
1) The caller maintains them and adds the height of each band

2) Each band updates a yOffset

STUFF TO SORT
Pairing an rbrwSource with a rbrwPositioner

Future stuff to abstract
- page matching model to abstract supplying page header/footer for a given page
- eg: might have different ones for alternate, facing pages.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-===-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
INHERITING STYLES

Context
We want to establish overall style settings for a group of reports with the ability to easily customise specific overrides.

Forces:
1) flexibility of API

2) easy to set global values for style

3) easy to implement now and make more sophisticated later

4) empower user!

ALTERNATIVES
1) simple 3 levels - local style in report object, report it's attached to or global default

2) OOFILE style - as for 1) but also use styles from containers (eg: oofRepLayoutBand containing oofRepBlock)
- very fast

3) Abstract the job of looking up a style, passing a context description that can include positional items (can be extended later without any major change to report items)
- still requires a given piece to know its container
- can maybe pass the object as a key?
- ability to vary according to page being rendered is very sophisticated, implies lookup style each time we render & may be impossible in RTF etc. output (do we care?)

DECISION - 2 for ease of implementing now, leave fancy feature for later

COLUMNAR BAND FLAVOURS

TEXT RENDERING VS OTHER CONTENT
Do I need pictures and other rendering alongside textual columns?

For now - no, will do later once have working and have decided how to abstract

ALTERNATIVES
1) Have a simple Column class which takes a TextSource

DECISION - 1

WIDTHS
Context
When calculating column layouts or in other bands, centre or right-alignment, we need to know the width of the band.

Overall page width is something that can vary depending on user choice of printer margins and paper type.

ALTERNATIVES
1) Width is passed down the calling chain to bands Render, like xOffset

2) Width is available through querying a currentEnvironment call (the non-thread-safe approach used in oofRep)
- limits us to a global or per-report value so doesn't allow bands to be indented or nested transparently

3) Width is set on the band
- doesn't cope with dynamic requirements
- doesn't allow for band to be reused in different places in a report

DECISION 1 - only way to get required flexibility


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-===-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
FEEDING A FIELD FACADE INTO COLUMNS

Context
Want to have an interface that allows us to feed a fieldFacade into a set of columns.

ALTERNATIVES
1) fieldFacade can list sources
- ties fieldFacade to knowing about reports

2) build sources in rbrwColumnList ctor loop that use column lookup by name
- bit awkward but doesn't violate encapsulation

DECISION - 2


IDEA
make the rbrwColumnarBand an iterator in its own right so it can intercept the reset of startIterator and advanceIterator and advance the running position (main reason).

Want to iterate through a typical SQL result with a column to break and be able to provide related company data on each break.

There are two aspects - triggering the break and

WHERE TO HANDLE SCALING

Context:
When you print in REALbasic, you need to scale 72dpi dimensions to match the printer. My previous printing work in RB used a universal scn measurement to cope with this and so just adjusted the scaling used by all scn-based rendering.

The current rbrw is based on the OOFILE model for Windows printing where the drawing actions are all recorded into a series of rbrwDrawingElement objects, much like a Macintosh PICT recording. (Historical note - the Windows eqivalent of metafiles was too buggy so we had to write our own.)

Considering the Windows model, oofRepWindow maintains mScalingFactor which is used by oofRepWindow::GetTransformedPageSize to size the rectangle which oofRepWindow::OnDraw passes into oofRepWindowGUIPreviewMFC::drawPage.

So, in that case, the environment is managing scaling by using a bounding rectangle size to set the native Win32 horizontal and vertical scaling. The oofDE drawing elements draw at an arbitrary size and their output is scaled accordingly.

Seeking an RB equivalent of this scaling:

Forces:
F1) Simplicity - want to change design as little as possible from OOFILE

F2) Must provide scaling for both printing and preview window zooming/fit.

F3) Avoid re-render. Don't want to have to recalculate a 200 page report just because have zoomed in.

ALTERNATIVES
1) implement global scaling for rbrwDrawingElement to be used on output
- somewhat coarse but we have global scaling elsewhere
- minimal code changes

2) push the scaling into rbrwCurrentDraw and have that used for all the drawing actions by rbrwDrawingElement with methods mimicing 
- keeps the drawing elements close to the Windows version
- not a huge amount of work

3) Create a ScaledGraphics subclass of Graphics which forwards instructions, managed by rbrwCurrentDraw
- most transparent to everything else
- need to be careful to reset it 
- TRIED AND FAILED - can't redirect properties

STRUCTURING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPORT

Context
Need to handle printing multiple statements and decide the data relationship on the report.

Reports have transaction data from one or more customers. The whole purpose of statements, unlike the A/R Aging report, is to provide per-customer statements.

ALTERNATIVE DATA MODELS
1) Primarily iterating through customers, with a break per customer. The transaction data is attached as a footer band to the break.

2) Iterating through a view of transactions which includes a customer ID. Break on a new customer ID and draw the customer details as a break header. This is a more traditional SQL view of the data.

WHEN TO TELL WE HAVE STARTED AND ENDED A BAND ON A PAGE

rbrwTreeBand_GraphicsRender.draw is called to draw each row.

mDrawnColHeadersThisPage is used to help decide if column headers should be drawn but in
rbrwTreeBand_GraphicsRender.startTableBody it is set true depending on shouldDrawViewColumnHeaders
to avoid any headers ever being drawn.

For variable-height bands we need to have a way to identify when the band ends - this will be 
when we run out of content or a DrawContinuingOverPage does a page break.

ALTERNATIVES
1) add something similar to mDrawnColHeadersThisPage but as a 
"start area on page" / "end area on page"
- only a minor design change from the current approach
- move the mDrawnColHeadersThisPage logic into this as a subset

2) record the lowest and highest values for the coords on a given page
- doesn't really provide the flexibility we need

RIGHT-JUSTIFICATION, PAGE COUNTS AND ABSTRACTIONS
The design of rbrw basically follows that of the OOFILE report-writer, specifically the Windows environment:
		specify a report layout using a few classes pointing to data sources
		choose an appropriate environment that acts as a factory to create renderer classes that mirror each of the layout classes
		renderers generate output as a series of Drawing Elements, collected into pages
		draw a single page on a preview window, or multiple pages to a printer.

The current task is to create a right-aligned page count eg: Page 1 of 3 for a report.

This poses two large and one small problems:
	1.	The page count is only available when you finish rendering all the pages, so the text needs updating on each page, after the main rendering phase
	2.	Drawing elements currently don’t align text as they render - the alignment is calculated in advance and the drawing element positioned to simply draw. If we can’t measure the text because it has yet to be drawn, then positions will vary.
	3.	Composition for a Page Number block rbrwPageNoBlock allows for a single static leading and trailing text string. The renderers for layout bands assume a single centered and single right-aligned block (which is probably why we hacked in the leading and trailing strings in the first place).
Forces
		A major consideration in the following design discussions is trying to keep the abstract model so it can easily map onto RTF, PDF and HTML/CSS layout. Whilst this doesn’t affect much, it may have an impact on Drawing Element (DE) implementation - I was hoping to adapt them pretty simply to write out PDF.
		As another general trend, I’m leaning towards abstracting block composition a little more to make it possible to place blocks arbitrarily on the page.
		Any solution adopted in the near term should fit into the current layout and rendering code with minimal change - the graphics rendering level is complex code and we don’t want some extended debugging time. (Yes, I’m a pragmatist.)
Page Count Calculation and Retrieval
The calculation is trivial, being the number of Pages saved by the end of the report. To retrieve this count I could use a Push or Pull model.
A Push model assumes some update occurs at end of the page construction phase.
		Push Visitor pattern would visit every element in a page to possibly apply the update.
		Push Observer pattern requires interested objects to subscribe as observers to be notified when the report page construction is complete.
A Pull model, with caching, would have each object that is interested in the page count defer pulling the count until the last possible instant, when it needs to render. It can then cache the result for redisplay (such as a user flipping back and forth in preview). In a previewed report, or printing only a subset of pages, many of the objects would never pull.
Right-alignment of Drawing Elements
The Drawing Element approach is a direct copy of the Macintosh PICT recording which records compact opcodes for draw operations. It was created because we started using Windows Metafiles only to find with Windows NT Workstation 4 that there were huge bugs in their playback - literally ends didn’t meet!
Either DE’s get smarter and handle right-alignment, for a composed block of DE’s or some fixup occurs, again for the composed block.
Looking at PDF - there’s no inherent specification of text as being left or right-aligned, just positioned absolutely. That matches the current DE design.
Recalling the rbrwLayoutBand restriction on a single right-aligned block, say we allowed multiple blocks to be right-aligned. If that occurs and there is dynamic content in a block, the others need adjusting at rendering time also.
At the very least, fixing up right-alignment in combination with a page number requires some kind of composite block. There’s an opportunity to drop a relatively smart object in here which pulls any values it needs as well as doing the alignment calculation when it has finished pulling. Behaviour at that point can revert to normal rbrwTextDE rendering.
Decision
Based on the above discussion of alternatives and a little inspiration, use a Pull model:
	1.	use a single rbrwComposedBlock to handle the entire right-aligned page number
	2.	Create new rbrwSource objects to supply page number and page count using delegates, to minimise the subclassing. These will delegate to an rbrwReport method.
	3.	An rbrwComposedBlock_Render will cache its result of pulling the page and page number as an rbrwGraphicsTextDE. If the block is aligned right, it will use that information to calculate the DE position.
