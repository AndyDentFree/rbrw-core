Core engine for REALbasic report-printing as a direct port from the [C++ OOFILE Report-writer](http://www.oofile.com.au/reportwriter.html).

Report layout can be specified in simple application code or XML (not yet ported).

This is a full-blown multi-level, banding report-writer capable of reports to rival Crystal Reports. The C++ version has been used by tens of thousands of users in applications worldwide, since 1998.

Plans for a commercial GUI layout tool are underway but not yet finalised to the point where they can be disclosed.
