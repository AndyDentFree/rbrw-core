The ideas to be discussed in here are for one or more components allowing end-users to compose reports. The general expectation for such components is usually to make them visual and based on direct manipulation, dragging content around.

However, I have found users very happy to just be able to choose what goes into a report and have the report-writer engine do a good job of working out the formatting, so the report-editor is a selection and minor styling component. There's certainly room for both approaches across the range of business applications that generate reports.
